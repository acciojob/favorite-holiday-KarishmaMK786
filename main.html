		<h1>Goa</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Goa , State, southwestern India. Area: 1,429 sq mi (3,702 sq km). Population: (2011) 1,457,723. Capital: Panaji. Located on India’s western coast, it is bordered by Maharashtra and Karnataka states. It has a 65-mi (105-km) coastline on the Arabian Sea and includes the offshore island of Goa. It was ruled by Hindu dynasties and Muslim sultanates until the late 15th century and came under Portuguese control in 1510. Their settlement of Old Goa became the capital of Portuguese India. After India attained independence in 1947, it demanded that Portugal cede Goa. Indian troops finally occupied Goa in 1961; it was subsequently incorporated into India as part of the territory of Goa, Daman, and Diu. It became a state in 1987, with Daman and Diu remaining as a union territory. Goa is predominantly agricultural; its distinctive architecture and fine beaches also make it a popular tourist destination.</p>
